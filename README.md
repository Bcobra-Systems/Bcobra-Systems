## What We Do

### 🔧 Custom Business Applications
We build apps that replace your spreadsheets, emails, and manual processes. Power Apps, SharePoint solutions, and custom web applications — designed for how your team actually works.

**Examples:** Order management systems, compliance tracking apps, inspection tools, request/approval workflows
